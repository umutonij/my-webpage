        <h1>Dogs</h1>
        <h2>Humankind loves animals</h2>
        <p>And as a result, they appear in many of the most beloved stories of all times. Animals, from dogs to snakes, play a very important role in popular culture: they have been and continue to be the inspiration for myths, tales and films that are ingrained into our collective memory.</p>
        <P>In many human stories, animals appear with a magical and even supernatural touch: we love exaggerating their skills and abilities. Regardless of the degree of fantasy we project onto them, the truth is that life without animals would not be the same.</P>
